# What's this?

This is a simple python library for creating 2D vectors and serializing them to SVG.  It also includes various utility routines that are helpful when creating SVG files for laser cutting.

# How do I...?

You read the code, for now.  I'm keeping this in a separate project for my own convenience, and maybe it'll be useful as something other than a submodule for my other projects eventually.  If you're curious, let me know and I'll make this documentation a bit better.
